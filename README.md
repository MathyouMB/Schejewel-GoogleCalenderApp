# Schejewel

Schejewel is an app that uses the Google Calendar API to find gaps in the schedules of several users and calculate ideal meeting times.
My current goal with this project is to create a small rails webapp that takes in a start and end date and updates the page to display ideal times.
You may notice the view portion is kind of a mess, and this is because I'm using this project as an oppurtunity to experiment with React, and the Materialize CSS framework.
